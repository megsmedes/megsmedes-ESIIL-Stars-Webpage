## Biography 
Nature is for me a place of comfort, adventure, wonder, and experiementation. As a child, I was always connected to the outdoors whether my yard, a hiking trail, or at summer camp.  So, it is no wonder that I persued a degree in Natural Resources in college. For 20 years, I have been an informal educator, from using Authority of the Resource as a Park Ranger to facilitating nature-play for preschoolers as a Tinkergarten leader.  For seven years of my career, I worked for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, teaching STEAM programs to schools throughout the Denver-Metro area. I recently earned a Certificate of GIS from MSUDenver and I would like to apply my cerficate to natural resource restoration and management.

## Excited for ESIIL Stars

I am exited to learn python and other coding language as I know it is applicable to GIS and other programs.  I have already learned so much just by getting to build this website through github! 

I want to gain experience with the processes of data collection and analysis.  I am mulling around some hypotheses to try and think of things we could study for the summer project.  I love plants, so I am thinking of how they could be incorporated.  I am glad to be here and I'm looking forward to working with all of you!
